# BMED 4803 Group 2 Unit 1 Final Project:

To understand our repository layout, here are the contents:

1. BMED4803_HW2:
    This is the code from our second homework, where we were tasked with creating a leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neuron model

2. BMED4803_HW3:
    This is the code for our third homework, where we added voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) to account for an action potential spike and refractory period. This introduced a new code into our previous code, and we addressed questions related to our collaboration methods, the VGSC function, and more.

3. Unit1FinalProj:
    This is the Jupyter Notebook file for our final unit 1 project. It includes both the LIF model and the updated LIF model, along with a feedforward artifical neural network (ANN) model. We discuss the ANN model and compare it to the previous models, detailing the information processing power, benefits, and limitations of each model (Note: the table feature in JupyterNotebook does not display well in GitHub. You'll need to open the JupyterNotebook file to see this table). Finally, we define artifical intelligence (AI) and the different key concepts behind the topic.
